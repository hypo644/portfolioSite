				<h2>jQuery-Based Quiz App</h2>

				<p>This was a quiz application that I developed during my time at Thinkful's bootcamp program. The topic is the saguaro cactus of the Sonoran Desert; I kept color schemes consistent with a largely brown landscape theme. Apart from the landing page, each page of the application is created and rendered through JavaScript and jQuery on a base of HTML and CSS. I made extensive use of single-purpose functions to create dynamic screens for every page of the quiz.</p>

				<p>This is a resume website that I am currently developing for an acquaintance to update his outdated original one. Because he has amassed over 20 years' worth of experience and projects, I placed each section on its own page. For the gallery section, I implemented a variety of methods to correctly render both images and videos in an orderly, visually-appealing way.</p>
